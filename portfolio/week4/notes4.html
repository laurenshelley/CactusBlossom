      WEEK 4 NOTES<br>

Mian Points: <br>

-Object-oriented programming<br>
-Using classes in javascript <br>
-Prototypes<br>
-Chaining functions <br>
-This and that <br>
-Borrowing methods from prototypes <br>

Object-oriented Programming<br>
	-The main concepts are encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance. <br>
 
Encapsulation<br>
		-This is the method of building data and methods that work with that<br> data into a single unit. 
	
	Polymorphism<br>
		-This method explains that different objects can be used and even <br>share the same method.
	Inheritance <br>
		-This is the process of taking bits and pieces of one method and <br>incorporating it into another. This way you can recycle and improve old methods without having to start completely from scratch. 

Classes in javascript <br>
	-Classes are used to name different objects. By naming the objects you <br> are able to call the objects in javascript as well as CSS. 

 Chaining Functions <br>
	-This is where one object can call multiple functions at a time helping<br> organize the code.
