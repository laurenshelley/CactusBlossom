      WEEK 5 READING/NOTES<br>

Stack traces <br>
	-A slack trace is when an error is detected. It works by starting where <br>the problem occurred so you can find the source of the problem. <br>

Warnings <br>
	-Warnings are nice because they will crash the application but it will not<br> fix itself. It will simply state that there is a problem and <br>the application will keep running. So if it’s a bigger issue, the issue will persist till the warning is fixed. <br>

Purpose and importance of debugging<br>
	-Debugging is important for the user’s sake. No one wants to use an app that<br> is always crashing or isn’t working properly. Its important to<br> always check your code because errors will not always appear when using javascript. <br>
	
Strict Mode<br>
-This is used to detect any errors or potential errors early on in coding. While<br> this my be annoying to always get errors it is better in the<br> long run because when you finish you know your code is working perfectly. <br>

Linting Tools <br>
	-This can be used for consistency. It’s great for group work because it will make<br> sure everyone is following the same guideline avoiding messy<br>work that doesn’t match down the road. <br>

Feature Detection<br>
	-This I think is really clever. Since not all code will be supported by all browsers <br>you can use an if statement in case code isn’t supported. By using an If statement you can say that IF this browser doesn’t support A use B. <br>

Debugging in Browser<br>
	-A good method of debugging is taking the code one section at a time. That way you <br>can rule out the good code and single out the code that isn’t working. An easy way to do this is by inspecting the code on a browser. <br>

Using the Console <br>
	-sing console.log is an amazing way to check if your code is working. It’s nice <br>because you can put it almost anywhere on your code and it will tell<br> you exactly what isn’t working through different errors. It can also tell you which line of code is where the problem began.<br>
