    <h1>NOTES AND READING</h1>
    <P>
       
        The readings main points: <BR>
        
        - Remembering Users Info <BR>
        -  How to structure HTML so its user friendly; organized how the user will want it to be.<BR>
        - How to use an array <BR>
        -  How to make an array <BR>
        - Groups vs loops <BR>
        -  How to use an associative array <BR>
        
            Remembering users info:<BR>
        The computer is not capable of remembering code unless you tell it to. If you close an application<BR> and you dont save it yourself or the application being used doesn’t save automatically, your work will<BR>lost. We can avoid this by making sure we are using an application or some way to always save our<BR> work. VSCO is awesome in this way because it is always saving our work and we can push out work <BR>to GitHub where it can be permanently saved and used late. <BR>
        
            How to structure HTML so it’s user-friendly:<BR>
        This is pretty easy to do, just look at the code from the user’s perspective. The example used was what <BR>if the user wanted to use an app to write a story. When someone is writing a story you usually put <BR>the title first then you write the story. Well with HTML that is exactly what were going to do. <BR>Make the Textbox for the Title of the story go first then put the box for writing the story next. <BR>
        
            How to use/make an array:<BR>
        Now, this topic is better covered through code but I will do my best to explain. You use an array when you <BR>are wanting to sort A LOT of information using the least amount of code possible. It makes it easier <BR>to call sections and you dont have to use a lot of different variables. You just list it in an<BR> array and it makes the information easier to access. <BR>
        
            How to use an associative array and what exactly is it used for?<BR>
        
        An associative array is something that is used to call data by using a specific name usually called a key.<BR> This makes sorting even larger amounts of data easier. <BR>
